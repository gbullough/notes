Mate in true Monty Python style “You lucky, lucky bastard!” 😊

But seriously fella I’m really pleased for you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

You’re probably the most genuine person I know, you’ve always had the knack of saying the right thing at the right time and because you know your stuff are truly 
respected by all the people who really matter in this world.

Other people will call you legend in MSL, and they are right. I’ll really miss you because you’ve always had my back. Your laugh has always been infectious, and 
you can always brighten up my day even when we moan like chuff about LUFC!

I’m totally gutted I can’t make your leaving lunch as I’m away on holiday, I will however raise a glass to you. 

I hope we keep in touch. Lots of big man hugs pal!
